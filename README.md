# cin Statements and Formatting
## Exercise 1

Complete the program so that a sample run inputting `22` for the number of items bought and `10.98` for the price of each item will produce the results below.

Sample run of the program:

`Please input the number of items bought`
**22**
`Please input the price of each item`
**10.98**
`The total bill is $241.5600`


## Exercise 2

Once you have the program working, change the statement:

`cout << setprecision (4) << fixed;`

to

`cout << setprecision(4);`

Rerun the program with the same data given in Exercise 1. 

How does the use of the `fixed`  manipulator change how the `setprecision` function formats the decimal number? Make a note in your notes about how `fixed` and `setprecision` work.

## Exercise 3

Now configure the program so that decimal numbers are formatted for two places to the right of the decimal point when outputted. You may need to put the `fixed` manipulator back and adjust the `setprecision` function.
